                  <p>For this project I have used layer masking in Photoshop to create one image, from hundreds of shots taken in the same location, compressing hours into a single moment.  In each picture I focus on key features, such as clothing, colour and gesture.  <br><br>I then layered images together to create the composition by manipulating minute details that we ordinarily overlook: a woman flipping her hair, a boy chasing a ball, or a man caught mid step.  I then mirrored the location and put only men on the left side of the image, and women on the right, creating a diptych that makes a commentary not about the divide between genders, but rather the relationship between time, location and people.  <br><br>Everyday there are countless tiny, unimportant moments that pass us by and are never recorded.  My intention here is to help people recognize these moments and discover that these typically mundane scenes, when combined together, create extraordinary images.
