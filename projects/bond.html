                  <p>The premise for this university project was to sculpt an object out of a 4' x 4' piece of plywood and install it on campus. Seeing as everyone was limited to the same material the main goal of this project was to have the students question the material and space of installation.<br><br> I decided to cut the 4' x 4' piece of plywood into strips and then fasten them together with twine and glue to create a six foot tall bridge. I then placed the work over the fence that separates the University of Toronto Scarborough campus from the forested valley below.<br><br>The idea behind this is that the material(plywood) is manufactured by bonding together several woods. I created a bridge or "Bond" between the natural valley and the manufactured campus.</p>
